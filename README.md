## Ebin
Creating a sophisticated network of ebins for a better waste management. We are developing a dustbin which notifies the muncipality manager and the User(Citizens) about the varying waste level of public wastebins in realtime. It also notifies the muncipality if more dustbins are required in a given area.


### Server

Both are made to run on the raspberry pi (Cloud) they can be accessed from there by any other person
The port 8000 is to be accessed from the external ip address of the RPi which shows the Google Maps with the Empty dustbin coloured in grreen and the Filled dustbin coloured in red.
