## Ebin
Creating a sophisticated network of ebins for a better waste management. We are developing a dustbin which notifies the muncipality manager and the User(Citizens) about the varying waste level of public wastebins in realtime. It also notifies the muncipality if more dustbins are required in a given area.


### Ebin folder and Server

Both are made to run on the raspberry pi (Cloud) they can be accessed from there by any other person
